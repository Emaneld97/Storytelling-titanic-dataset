#First hypothesis: More females survived than males.
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x="sex", y="survived", data=titanic)

#then the hypothesis is true: females survived than males

#Work on your hypothesis 2 here

#More old people survived than young people
sns.barplot(x="age", y="survived", data=titanic, estimator='mean')

#The hypothesis is somehow true, but More old people and children survived than young adults.

#Work on your hypothesis 3 here

#Third hypoyjesis: people who were alone were more likely to survive than those who were not alone.
sns.barplot(x="alone", y="survived", data=titanic)

#The hypothesis is false as more people of those who were not alone survived
